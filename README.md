# Work Day Planner

## Description

A work day planner was built so the user is able to plan their day by writting down a task to complete at a specific time (from 9 to 5), the schedule will provide the current date and it will be able to show the current hour based on the colour of the text boxes (grey for past, red for present, and green for future). With this the user can save those tasks by pressing its corresponding save button. These tasks will then persist unless they are erased and saved again. Building this project helped me apply the knowledge i've learned regarding third-party-APIs as well as to help me plan, and orginize how to approach the logic behind the schedule before starting to write code. This was done by pseudocoding and brainstorming all possible tasks required for the schedule to work, one this was done I started to code any variables i might need before writting any functions.

## Usage

To use the Work Day Planner click [Here!](https://renfunny.github.io/Work-day-Planner/)
When opened, the webpage should look similar to the image found below. Here the user will be able to check the current date and time from 9AM to 5PM. Each textbox can be used to write a task which can be saved by clicking the save button on the right of the textbox. Only the save button on the right of the textbox will save that textbox's task, which is why each textbox has its own save button. Once the task is stored it will persist unless it is erased and saved again.
